## notes from ZHD feedback session Thursday 20th August

- keep stating the basic argument again and again
- are voice assistants _designed_ this way or is it a byproduct of the design process.
- precision about the argument, precision about the cause and effect
- what exactly are we saying is bad? What is harm and to whom? What morally relevant effects would redressing the imbalance?
- Is increased capability is a good thing? Comparison to facial recognition - as an example. Black faces reocgnised less accurately? Would better recognition actually _benefit_ those minority groups?
- tighten up the argument, state it clearly in the intro.
- privilege and class - are they conflated with _race_ - be precise about this.
- be clear about what you attribute to things
- try to avoid saying things which remind people of a "fanatic activist view"
