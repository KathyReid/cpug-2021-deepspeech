\f0\fs24 \cf0 #### Feedback for Kathy from Liz (11 August 2020):\
\
I think your talk has a nice cadence to it that is appropriate for this audience. Well done there. Generally, I can see how ideas are coming together here. I'm hoping the comments below help you think about how you can clarify this issue for attendees who may not be experts in this area, while also helping those who have more expertise come to some useful realisations. I've tried to bold my references to particular parts of your talk (and sorry for not commenting straight in the markdown, if that's what you wanted me to do -- I didn't want to mess up your flow!)\

**Re: cloud provider language support:**\
-	Would be powerful to find some data on market opportunities as a function of language, and place these side by side (so seek evidence to support your assertion)\
-	Your comparison to global development index is a nice alternative; does it map directly to market opportunity for these technologies?\
\
The move to **\'93The low-resource language problem\'94** seems jarring \'85 I almost want to see each of these placed (one at a time, and maybe not in this order) on a diagram showing some of the forces involved in shaping these systems, so the audience goes away with a visual you can summarize. \
But before building such an illustration, I feel like there needs to be a key summary for what a voice assistant NEEDS to come into being (probably when you introduce the stack). What does it need to continue to refine its performance for a given population (defined loosely here)? What data is required, where is it typically found / created, etc \'85 I suggest this so your audience has a very clear understanding of the ingredients of these systems, and can then relate each of the issues you\'92re bringing up clearly to those ingredients. They can see how these external forces shape the voice assistant products very clearly.\
\
**Re: the what could voice assistants enable (re: racial profiling, etc\'85):** I see this as somewhat different to the issues you're raising in this talk, though it is an important issue. Could leave the audience with more of a question; e.g. Ok, we find a way to create voice assistants that more of the world can access and use, but what other possibilities (good or bad) does this enable? This is almost more of an end question, and it changes the direction of your talk, so this needs to be considered carefully. Alternatively specifically narrow the scope of this talk at the start to forces shaping voice assistants; you can note as an aside there are other questions about what voice assistants enable that can and should be considered for those working in this field. \
\
**Re: voices that sound like mine.** I am wondering if there is any literature relating to minority identity / belonging in reference to, e.g., popular media you can draw on here? \
\
**Re: change:**\
Here\'92s where the diagram you have built comes in handy. I\'92m suggesting you raise them as questions for the audience, followed with examples of possible ways forward to help generate ideas. Do highlight cases (particularly open source ones that make use of python in some capacity, as that is relevant to your proposal) where you can find evidence that a particular solution has been shown to lead to change, wherever possible, even if you have limited examples. Do try and find cases where people outside of the $$-making industry are forging interesting paths that look like they may lead to a very different (more inclusive) kind of voice assistant. \
\
**Re: greater diversity in tech:** Consider highlighting here that making tech accessible to those who don\'92t see themselves as \'93in tech\'94 is a plausible and useful option.\
